## Contrast
The difference in brightness between light and dark areas of an image. Contrast determines the number of shades in the image. A low-contrast image (left) retains detail, but tends to lack dimension and look soft. An image with normal contrast (center) retains detail and dimension, and looks crisp.

## Histogram for image
An image histogram is a graph showing how many pixels in an image have a specific brightness (intensity) level, with the horizontal axis representing intensity (e.g., 0-255 for black to white) and the vertical axis showing the count (frequency) of pixels at that level, revealing the image's contrast and tonal distribution for analysis and enhancement.

The shape of the graph instantly indicates the level of contrast in the image:
High Contrast: A high-contrast image will have a histogram with data and peaks spread out across the entire horizontal axis, often with prominent spikes on both the far left (deep shadows) and far right (bright highlights), and a valley or fewer pixels in the mid-tones. This wide distribution means there is a large difference between the lightest and darkest parts of the image.
Low Contrast: A low-contrast image will have a histogram where all the data and peaks are clustered together in a narrow band, often in the center (mid-tones). This indicates a lack of true blacks and whites and subtle differences between tones, resulting in a flat or muted appearance.
