Develop a spell-checking application that uses a trie to store a dictionary of valid words.
Implement a trie to store the dictionary and write functions to insert words, delete words,
and check if a word is valid. Additionally, implement a function to suggest corrections for
misspelled words by finding the closest matches in the trie..
