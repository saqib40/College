Develop a system to manage student records. Each student has a name, roll number, and
marks in three subjects. Use nested structures to store this information. Additionally, use an
enumerated type to represent the grade (A, B, C, D, F) based on the average marks. Write a
program to input student details, calculate the average marks, assign a grade, and display
the student information.
