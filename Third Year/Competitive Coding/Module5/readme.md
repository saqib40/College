Develop a resource allocation system for a project management tool. Each task has a specific
importance and resource requirement. Implement the knapsack problem to allocate
resources to the tasks in a way that maximizes the total importance within the given
resource constraints. Write functions to solve the problem using dynamic programming and
display the optimal allocation
